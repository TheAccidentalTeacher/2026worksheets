## 3. EXTRACTION STATUS

### 3.1 Current Status

```
Extraction Progress: ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ 0%

Total Kits: 49
Extracted: 0
Remaining: 49
```

### 3.2 Extraction Plan

PowerPoint files (.pptx) are actually ZIP archives containing images. To extract:

1. **Rename** `.pptx` to `.zip`
2. **Unzip** the file
3. **Navigate** to `ppt/media/` folder
4. **Copy** all image files (usually .png, .emf, .wmf)
5. **Convert** EMF/WMF to PNG if needed
6. **Rename** with descriptive keywords

### 3.3 Automated Extraction Script

Location: `scripts/extract-servier-assets.ts` (TO BE CREATED)

The script will:
1. Loop through all .pptx files
2. Extract images from each
3. Convert to PNG format
4. Organize into category folders
5. Generate keyword metadata
6. Index in database

## 4. USAGE GUIDE

### 4.1 When to Use Servier Assets

**IDEAL FOR:**
- ✅ Human anatomy diagrams
- ✅ Cell biology illustrations
- ✅ Organ systems (heart, lungs, digestive, etc.)
- ✅ Medical/health topics
- ✅ Chemistry and lab equipment
- ✅ Scientific processes

**NOT IDEAL FOR:**
- ❌ Non-science topics (history, geography landmarks)
- ❌ Cartoon/playful style for young children
- ❌ Photos (these are illustrations)
- ❌ Complex scenes (these are individual elements)

### 4.2 Search Priority in Asset Resolver

```
1. Servier SMART (local) → FREE, instant, accurate
2. Freepik API          → Paid API, broader selection
3. Vecteezy API         → Paid API, fallback
4. AI Generation        → Last resort, less accurate
```

### 4.3 Combining Assets

Many worksheets will combine multiple Servier assets:

**Example: "Parts of a Cell" worksheet**
- Cell membrane from `Cell-membrane.pptx`
- Nucleus from `Intracellular-components.pptx`
- Mitochondria from `Intracellular-components.pptx`

### 6.2 Keyword → File Mapping (To Be Generated)

After extraction, we'll create a detailed keyword index:

```json
{
  "heart": ["Heart-physiology/heart-01.png", "Heart-physiology/heart-02.png"],
  "lungs": ["Respiratory-system/lungs-01.png"],
  "cell": ["Cell-membrane/cell-01.png", "Intracellular-components/cell-02.png"],
  "dna": ["Genetics/dna-01.png", "Nucleic-acids/dna-helix.png"],
  ...
}
```

This index will be stored in:
- `assets/servier-smart/index.json` - Keyword lookup
- Database `Asset` table - Full metadata with search
